# Campus-Connect
Fullstack-project

CampusConnect is a full-stack web application designed to enhance collaboration and communication among university students. Inspired by platforms like Reddit, it enables students to create and join virtual rooms for hackathons, academic projects, clubs, and events. This community-driven platform allows students to post requirements, find teammates, discuss ideas, and make announcements â€” all within a centralized digital space exclusive to their university.
Built using modern web technologies, CampusConnect employs React.js on the frontend for building responsive, component-based user interfaces and form handling. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, supporting RESTful APIs, routing, middleware handling, and serving static files. MongoDB is used as the primary database for storing user accounts, posts, events, and group data in flexible document structures.

The system uses cookies and session-based authentication to manage user access securely, ensuring that only verified university members can post or join groups. Key features include:
Role-based user authentication
Project and event posting with categories
Team-up functionality for hackathons and group work
Commenting and upvoting (discussion threads)
Dynamic room creation and joining
Real-time updates via backend event handling
CampusConnect aims to bridge the communication gap within university ecosystems, making it easier for students to find peers, collaborate on initiatives, and stay informed about campus activities.
